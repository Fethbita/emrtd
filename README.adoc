= Rust eMRTD

== Introduction

A library that can read an eMRTD (Electronic Machine Readable Travel Document).

The `emrtd` crate provides a simple API that can be used to communicate with
eMRTDs and read the data that resides within them. With the help of openssl,
it can perform Passive Authentication.

[WARNING]
====
Currently Active Authentication (AA), Chip Authentication (CA), PACE or EAC are *not* supported.
